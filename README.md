[Lab 01: Navigating the terminal and viewing a brain using fsl/spm/afni.](Notebooks/Lab_01_Navigating_the_terminal.ipynb)  
In this lab we cover the basics of ssh logging into a cluster server and using a VNC environment. We learn about basic shell commands that can be used for navigating the terminal. We launch different fMRI analysis softwares, FSL, SPM, and AFNI, for interactive viewing of brain images.
